# CS50P â€“ Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my solutions, problem sets, and final project from [Harvard's CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/), an introduction to programming with Python.

The course focuses on practical problem-solving using Python and covers topics including:

- Functions and arguments
- Conditionals and loops
- Data structures: strings, lists, dictionaries, sets
- File I/O and exceptions
- Unit testing and debugging
- Regular expressions and libraries
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
