This repository contains my solutions and final project from [Harvard's CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/). The aim was to practice python fundementals and problem solving. This is both a personal learning log and a showcase of my Python skills demonstrating what I have learned during this course.

## Contents
- **Problem Set 0 — Functions & Variables**  
  Basics of input/output, string manipulation, and simple functions.
- **Problem Set 1 — Conditionals**  
  Branching logic, comparisons, and nested decisions.
- **Problem Set 2 — Loops**  
  Iteration, state handling, and string traversal.
- **Problem Set 3 — Exceptions**  
  Error handling, input validation, and robust programs.
- **Problem Set 4 — Libraries**  
  Using Python’s standard and external libraries, including APIs.
- **Problem Set 5 — Unit Testing**  
  Writing automated tests with `pytest` for reliable code.
- **Problem Set 6 — File I/O**  
  Reading from, writing to, and manipulating files.
- **Problem Set 7 — Regular Expressions**  
  Pattern matching, data validation, and text parsing.
- **Problem Set 8 — Object-Oriented Programming**  
  Classes, objects, encapsulation, and stateful programs.
- **Final Project**  
  A self-designed project applying everything learned throughout the course.

## Skills Gained
- Python fundamentals — variables, functions, loops, conditionals  
- Data structures — lists, dictionaries, sets, and basic algorithms  
- File handling, libraries, and APIs
- Testing and debugging 
- Regular expressions for validation and parsing  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — classes, objects, methods  
- Version control with **Git** and **GitHub**
